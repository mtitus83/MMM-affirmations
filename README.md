## Features

- Retrieves random affirmations from a local text file containing over 100 affirmations
- Displays affirmations with a fade in/out effect
- Configurable update interval and fade speed
- Uses a node helper for efficient affirmation selection

## Installation

1. Navigate to your MagicMirror's `modules` folder:
   ```
   cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/
   ```
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mtitus83/MMM-affirmations.git
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   cd MMM-affirmations
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `config/config.js` file:

```javascript
{
    module: "MMM-affirmations",
    position: "top_right",
    config: {
        updateInterval: 60000,  // Update every minute
        fadeSpeed: 1500  // Fade transition takes 1.5 seconds
    }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `updateInterval` | Time between affirmation updates in milliseconds (default: 60000) |
| `fadeSpeed` | Speed of the fade in/out effect in milliseconds (default: 1500) |

## How It Works

1. The node helper loads affirmations from the `affirmations.txt` file in the module directory.
2. When requested, the node helper selects a random affirmation from the loaded list.
3. The affirmation is sent to the main module and displayed with a fade-in effect.
4. The affirmation remains visible for the configured `updateInterval`.
5. The process repeats with a new affirmation.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the module by modifying the `MMM-affirmations.css` file in the module directory.

To add, remove, or modify affirmations, edit the `affirmations.txt` file in the module directory. Each affirmation should be on a new line.
